cosmodroma is a terminal planetarium which allows you to track and preview bright stars, planets and satellites in real time (like the ISS).

# Usage
1. install requirements with `pip -r requirements.txt`
2. open cosmodroma with `python cosmodroma.py`
If this is the first install, it will take a while to download cosmological data.
